`MVC` stands for `Model-View-Controller`. It's a popular `architectural pattern` used in software development, especially for building `user interfaces`. MVC helps `separate` the application logic into `three` distinct parts:

1. **`Model`:** This represents the `data` and core `business logic` of your application. It handles data manipulation and enforces business rules.
   for instance, the `Product` interface defines the structure of a product, and you could have additional logic related to product validation or calculations within a ProductService class.

2. **`View`:** This is responsible for `presenting` the data `to the user`. It translates the data from the `model` into a user-friendly format, typically using HTML, CSS, or a templating language. In the example, there are no views explicitly defined, but if you were using a templating engine, the views would handle displaying product lists or individual product details.

3. **`Controller`:** This acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user `interaction` from the `view` (like button clicks or form submissions), interacts with the model to update data or perform actions, and then instructs the view to update itself accordingly.

By separating these concerns, MVC offers several advantages:

- **Improved Maintainability:** Changes to one part (model, view, or controller) are less likely to `impact` other parts, making the code easier to understand and modify.
- **Testability:** Each component can be tested independently, making it easier to identify and fix bugs.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Developers can focus on specific aspects of the application without worrying about the intricate details of other parts.
- **Reusability:** Controllers and models can potentially be reused across different views.

Overall, MVC is a well-established pattern that promotes clean code organization and simplifies development for web applications.
