# Overview of Express.js framework

`Express.js` is a minimalist web application `framework` for `Node.js` that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It is designed to be `lightweight`, `flexible`, and `unopinionated`, allowing developers to create `server-side` applications quickly and efficiently.

## Key Features:

1. **`Routing`**: Express.js provides a simple and intuitive routing mechanism that allows developers to define routes for handling HTTP requests. Routes can be defined for various `HTTP methods` (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URL patterns.

2. **`Middleware`**: Middleware functions are the heart of Express.js. They are functions that have access to the request and response objects and can modify or terminate the request-response cycle. Express.js comes with built-in middleware functions for handling tasks such as parsing request bodies, serving static files, and implementing security features.

3. **`Template Engines`**: Express.js supports various template engines, such as EJS, Pug (formerly Jade), and Handlebars, allowing developers to generate dynamic HTML content easily.

4. **`Error Handling`**: Express.js provides robust error handling capabilities, allowing developers to define error-handling middleware functions to handle errors gracefully. Error-handling middleware functions can catch errors that occur during request processing and generate appropriate error responses.

5. **`Static File Serving`**: Express.js makes it easy to serve static files, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, using the express.static middleware function.

6. **`RESTful Routing`**: Express.js supports RESTful routing principles, making it easy to build RESTful APIs with clean and organized route structures.

7. **`Session Management`**: Express.js provides support for session management using middleware packages like express-session, allowing developers to store session data on the server-side and manage user sessions.

8. **Middleware Customization**: Express.js allows developers to create custom middleware functions to implement application-specific logic, such as authentication, logging, and request validation.
